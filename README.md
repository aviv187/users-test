# users-test - work assignment

## Notes

- The app was tested only on Chrome.
- In the task it was asked to refresh the users list every 3s, but becouse I worked with firebase realtime database it was redundant.

## Run Locally

- run "npm i" in the terminal.
- run "npm run start" in the terminal.
